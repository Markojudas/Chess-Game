## About

<p>A Chess Game application created on C# .NET Framework for Windows.</p>

<p>At the start of the application you will be welcomed by a small form to set the players' name and the time limit with the increment after each move.</p>

<p>Note: several games can be created and played.</p>

<p>The clock starts when a White player makes the first move. After the first move the clock for the Black player will start decrementing until a move is made, then it will increment depending on the set value. Each move will be recorded on the right side of the screen.</p>
